        question: "Can I open an SBI Fixed Deposit Account online?",

    {
        question: "How can I get ₹10,000 interest monthly in SBI?",
        answer: "To earn ₹10,000 in monthly interest, you need to invest a principal amount that generates this payout based on the interest rate. For example, at an annual rate of 7.5%, the required principal is: ₹10,000 × 12 ÷ 7.5% = approx. ₹16 lakhs So, an investment of ₹16–17 lakhs in a monthly income FD or annuity plan could give you ₹10,000 per month, depending on the scheme. Use an FD calculator to adjust for real-time rates and payouts.",
